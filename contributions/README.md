# Contributions

This directory is meant for contributed install scripts that have been used to successfully install the LOFAR software on your own, external system. Please add any install scripts using a pull request.

Note that those scripts have been proven to work in a specific environment. Don't expect them to work out of the box without any changes.

List of scripts:
deploy-das5.sh - Used to deploy the software on the ASTRON cluster of DAS5 to be used on the whole cluster.
deploy-flits.sh - Used to deploy the software in a virtualenv on a flits node.
